Using Tools to Collect and Organize Data: Citi Bike and Weather Analysis

For our final project in IST 652: Scripting for Data Analytics, we worked with the Citi Bike dataset, which tracks bike rentals in New York City. Our goal was to find patterns in bike usage and understand what factors affect ridership. We focused on July, August, and September because these months had the most rides. Since the data for each month was in separate files, we had to gather, clean, and combine them before analyzing. Each month’s data had around 4–5 million rows, so organizing it properly was very important.

To make our analysis more detailed, we also used weather data. At first, we merged weather data with all three months, but later we decided to focus only on September since it had the highest number of rides. To compare the two datasets, we added an hour column to the Citi Bike data so that it could match with the hourly weather data. This helped us see how weather conditions affected bike usage. Our goal was to provide useful insights that could help New York City improve its bike-sharing system.
How We Collected and Organized the Data

Since we were working with large amounts of data, we used different tools and techniques to make the process easier. We first downloaded the Citi Bike data from the official website for the months we wanted to analyze. Then, we cleaned the data by fixing dates and times, removing missing values, trimming column names, converting coordinates to numbers, and deleting duplicate entries. We also removed any negative trip durations, as they were errors in the data.
For the weather data, we removed columns that we didn’t need and kept only important details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. To make analysis easier, we added week and week-of-the-month information and calculated daily weather averages. We then merged the cleaned bike and weather data by matching the hour and week, creating a well-organized dataset that connected Citi Bike trips with weather conditions.
